# Oppfi Framework

Once you have configured your project in your IDE you can build it from there. Run `src/test/java/api/TestClass.java` file

> The code will not work properly without `src/test/resources/config.properties` file. For security purpose it added to `.gitignore` file. This file will be provided via zip archive

However if you prefer you can use maven from the command line. In that case you could be interested in this short list of commands:

* `mvn compile`: it will just compile the code of your application and tell you if there are errors
* `mvn test`: it will compile the code of your application and your tests. It will then run your tests (if you wrote any) and let you know if some fails
